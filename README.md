#Retriable

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kamui/retriable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kamui/retriable)

Retriable is an simple DSL to retry a code block if an exception should be raised.  This is especially useful when interacting external api/services or file system calls.

##Installation

via command line:

```ruby
gem install retriable
```

In your ruby script:

```ruby
require 'retriable'
```

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'retriable'
```

##Usage

Code in a retriable block will be retried if an exception is raised. By default, Retriable will rescue any exception inherited from `StandardError` (and `Timeout::Error`, which does not inherit from `StandardError` in ruby 1.8) and make 3 retry attempts before raising the last exception.

```ruby
require 'retriable'

class Api
  # Use it in methods that interact with unreliable services
  def get
    Retriable.retriable do
      # code here...
    end
  end
end
```

###Options

Here are the available options:

`tries` (default: 3) - Number of attempts to make at running your code block

`interval` (default: 0) - Number of seconds to sleep between attempts, or code block, or array

`timeout` (default: 0) - Number of seconds to allow the code block to run before raising a Timeout::Error

`on` (default: [StandardError, Timeout::Error]) - `StandardError` and `Timeout::Error` or array of exceptions to rescue for each attempt

`on_retry` - (default: nil) - Proc to call after each attempt is rescued

You can pass options via an options `Hash`. This example will only retry on a `Timeout::Error`, retry 3 times and sleep for a full second before each attempt.

```ruby
Retriable.retriable :on => Timeout::Error, :tries => 3, :interval => 1 do
  # code here...
end
```

You can also specify multiple errors to retry on by passing an array of exceptions.

```ruby
Retriable.retriable :on => [Timeout::Error, Errno::ECONNRESET] do
  # code here...
end
```

You can also specify a timeout if you want the code block to only make an attempt for X amount of seconds. This timeout is per attempt.

```ruby
Retriable.retriable :timeout => 1 do
  # code here...
end
```

If you need millisecond units of time for the sleep or the timeout:

```ruby
Retriable.retriable :interval => (200/1000.0), :timeout => (500/1000.0) do
  # code here...
end
```

Or you can supply a list of values for the intervals:

```ruby
Retriable.retriable :interval => [3, 5, 8, 13, 21] do
  # code here...
end
```

###Exponential Backoff

If you'd like exponential backoff, interval can take a Proc

```ruby
# with exponential back-off - sleep 4, 16, 64, 256, give up
Retriable.retryable :times => 4, :interval => lambda {|attempts| 4 ** attempts} do
  # code here...
end
```
###Callbacks

Retriable also provides a callback called `:on_retry` that will run after an exception is rescued. This callback provides the number of `tries`, and the `exception` that was raised in the current attempt. As these are specified in a `Proc`, unnecessary variables can be left out of the parameter list.

```ruby
do_this_on_each_retry = Proc.new do |exception, tries|
  log "#{exception.class}: '#{exception.message}' - #{tries} attempts."}
end

Retriable.retriable :on_retry => do_this_on_each_retry do
  # code here...
end
```

###Ensure/Else

What if I want to execute a code block at the end, whether or not an exception was rescued ([ensure](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-ensure))? Or, what if I want to execute a code block if no exception is raised ([else](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-else))? Instead of providing more callbacks, I recommend you just wrap retriable in a begin/retry/else/ensure block:

```ruby
begin
  Retriable.retriable do
    # some code
  end
rescue => e
  # run this if retriable ends up re-rasing the exception
else
  # run this if retriable doesn't raise any exceptions
ensure
  # run this no matter what, exception or no exception
end
```

##Kernel Extension

If you want to call `Retriable.retriable` without the `Retriable` module prefix and you don't mind extending `Kernel`,
there is a kernel extension available for this.

In your ruby script:

```ruby
require 'retriable/core_ext/kernel'
```

or in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'retriable', require: 'retriable/core_ext/kernel'
```

and then you can call `retriable` in any context like this:

```ruby
retriable do
  # code here...
end
```

##Credits

Retriable was originally forked from the retryable-rb gem by [Robert Sosinski](https://github.com/robertsosinski), which in turn originally inspired by code written by [Michael Celona](http://github.com/mcelona) and later assisted by [David Malin](http://github.com/dmalin). The [attempt](https://rubygems.org/gems/attempt) gem by Daniel J. Berger was also an inspiration.
